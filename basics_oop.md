# Pillars of Oop
## 1. Inheritance 
- Sharing of information
- Base class inherits derive class
- One class acquires the property of another class
## 2. Abstraction
- Hiding of information
- Handles complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user
- Eg. is like we hide our details at an ATM
## 3. Encapsulation
- Grouping of information
- Binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, 
- keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse(including class, methods, variables)
- Eg. like in capsules, medicine is safe
## 4. Polymorphism
- Redefining of information
- Ability of an object to take on many forms
- Eg. A man can play diff roles, like doctor for patients, father for son etc
