# Python Knowledge

Here is how python useful in the real-world !üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£

- Web Development :   

Python web frameworks are known for their security, scalability, and flexibility. To add to that, Python's Package Index comes with useful libraries like Requests, BeautifulSoup, Paramiko, Feedparser and Twisted Python (Django, Flask, Cherrypy)

- Game Development :  

PySoy (a 3D game engine that supports Python 3) and PyGame are two Python- based libraries used widely for game development. Python is the foundation for popular games like Battlefield 2, Frets on Fire, World of Tanks, Disney's Toontown Online, Vega Strike and Civilization-IV (Pygame, Arcade, Pandas3D)

- AI & ML & DL & Data Science :   

Python's simplicity, consistency, platform independence, great collection of resourceful libraries, and an active community make it the perfect tool for developing AI and ML applications (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras, Tensorflow, scikit-learn)

- Software Development :   

From developing complex applications that involve scientific and numeric computing to developing desktop and web applications, Python can do it all. This is the reason why Software Developers use Python as a support langusge for build control, testing and management.

- Operating Systems :   

Python is the secret ingredient behind many operating systems as well, most populary of Linux distributions. Linux- based Ubuntu's Ubiquity Installer and Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise's Anaconda Installer are coded in Python. Even Gentoo Linux leverages Python Portage(package management system).

- Desktop GUI :   
Python offers many GUI toolkits and frameworks that make desktop application development a breeze. PyQt, PyGtk, Kivy, Tkinyer, WxPython, PyGUI and PySide are some of the best Python- based GUI frameworks that allow developers to create highly functional Graphical User Interfaces(GUIs).

- Language Development :   
Python's design and module architecture has been the inspiration behind the development of many new programming languages such as Boo, Swift, CoffeeScript, Cobra and OCaml. All of these languages share numerous similarities with Python on grounds like object model, syntax and indentation.  

- Hacking Tools with Python :  
Cryptograpgy, Socket, Request, etc

- Biology and Bio-Information :  
Biopython, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc

## Why is Python slow?
- Python is an interpreted language (it is translated into bytecode which later interpreted into the machine code) while language like C++ is compiled (it compiles/translated into machine code which cpu understands).
- Let's see an example: Playing normal games on PC : Fast(C++)   
while using emulator to play Mobile games on PC : Slow(Python)
- Python is Dynamically typed while C++ is static (Garbage collection in Python)  
``` We can say no language is better than other.   ```  
```If you want to build software/games C++ is a better choice ```   
```You want to play with data and build web, Python is better choice ```
